# Sharepoint Document Library Connector

## Overview

The sharepoint library connector integration allows you to setup a connector between a document library in a sharepoint site and a KB in botpress.

## Configuration

Add the following keys to the integration’s `configuration` block:

- **clientId** (required) — Application (client) ID of your Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) app registration.  
- **tenantId** (required) — Directory (tenant) ID of the same app registration.  
- **thumbprint** (required) — Thumbprint of the certificate uploaded to the app registration.  
- **privateKey** (required) — PEM-formatted private key that matches the certificate (everything between `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`).  
- **primaryDomain** (required) — SharePoint primary domain (the part before `.sharepoint.com`).  
  *Example*: `contoso`  
- **siteName** (required) — Name of the SharePoint site that owns the document libraries you want to sync.  
- **documentLibraryNames** (optional) — Comma-separated list **or** JSON array of document libraries to sync.  
  *Examples*:  
  `Policies,Procedures`  
  `["Policies","Procedures"]`  
- **folderKbMap** (optional) — JSON object that maps `kbId` ⇒ array of folder prefixes for routing files to specific KBs.  
  *Example*:  
  `{"kb-marketing":["Campaigns"],"kb-policies":["HR","Legal"]}`  

**Tip:**  
- If you omit `documentLibraryNames`, **all** document libraries in the specified site will be synced.  
- If you omit `folderKbMap`, every file is routed to the default KB configured for its library.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Due to reliability issues, **Moves** and **Copies** are not supported. Those events from sharepoint will not reflect in the knowledge bases. If you wish to move/copy a file to another location, **Upload** or **Create** the file instead. 

## How to's

### How to register an app on Microsoft Entra admin center

- From the Home page of Microsoft Entra admin center, Open App registrations ( This is under Applications in the Left Nav )
- Add a new registration by clicking on “+ New registration”
- Give your app an appropriate name, and click register.
- Open the App registration and take note of the following:
  - `Application (client) ID`
  - `Directory (tenant) ID`

### How to create a certificate for your app registration

- We will be using a self-signed certificate to authenticate, to create a self-signed certificate run the following commands in order
- `openssl genrsa -out myPrivateKey.key 2048` → This will generate a 2048-bit private key and save it as myPrivateKey.key.
- `openssl req -new -key myPrivateKey.key -out myCertificate.csr` → This will create a CSR cert. You will be prompted to enter some information, fill as needed.
- `openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in myCertificate.csr -signkey myPrivateKey.key -out myCertificate.crt` → This will create a certificate file named myCertificate.crt that is valid for 365 days.

### How to add your certificate to your app registration

- Navigate to the Azure portal and go to your Azure AD app registration.
- Under “Certificates & secrets,” choose “Certificates” and click “Upload certificate.”
- Upload your .crt

### How to update API permissions for your app registration

- Go to “API Permissions” it should be under the Manage Group, in your App Registration "
- Click “Add a permissions”
- click on "Microsoft Graph".
- Select “Application permissions” as the type of permission.
- Check `Sites.FullControl.All`  , `Sites.Manage.All` , `Sites.Read.All` , `Sites.ReadWrite.All`, `Sites.Selected.All`, `Files.Read.All` and `Files.ReadWriteAll`
- Click “Add a permissions again.”
- Click the “Add a permission” button again
- Scroll till you find Sharepoint and click on it.
- Select “Application permissions” as the type of permission.
- Check `Sites.FullControl.All`  , `Sites.Manage.All` , `Sites.Read.All` , `Sites.ReadWrite.All` and `Sites.Selected.All`
- Click “Add permissions.”
- You should see All the permissions you added in the permissions list.
- Click on “Grant admin consent for <your_org_name>”

## Folder‑to‑KB Mapping (`folderKbMap`)

*This is an **optional** advanced feature. If you skip it, every file in the document library will go to the single KB you specified above.*

### Why use it?
Sometimes one SharePoint document library contains several distinct collections of content—HR procedures, Legal policies, Marketing campaigns, etc.—but you want each collection to live in its **own** Botpress KB for cleaner search results and permissions.  
`folderKbMap` lets you do exactly that.

### How it works
* `folderKbMap` is a **JSON object** whose keys are **KB IDs** and whose values are **arrays of folder prefixes** (relative paths) to watch.  
* During sync, the integration checks each file’s server‑relative path.  
  * If the path **starts with** one of the prefixes you listed, that file is routed to the corresponding KB.  
  * If no prefix matches, the file falls back to the default KB for the library.

### Configuration syntax
```jsonc
// Example: route folders within the libraries
"folderKbMap": {
  "kb-id-1": ["doclib1","doclib1/ExampleFolder/2025"],
  "kb-id-2":  ["doclib2/HR","doclib2/ExampleFolder"]
}
```
*Prefixes are **case‑insensitive** and may include simple wildcards (`*`).*

### Rules & limitations
1. **No KB sharing across libraries.** A single KB **cannot** receive content from two different libraries—even via folder mapping.  
2. **Create KBs first.** All KB IDs used in `folderKbMap` must already exist in Botpress before you save the configuration.
3. **Recursive files** Every file within a document library, regardless whether it is in a nested folder - will be recursively copied.

### Quick checklist
| ✔ | Step |
|---|------|
| Create a **separate KB** for each content group you want. |
| Identify folder (or folder‑prefix) boundaries inside the SharePoint library. |
| Build a `folderKbMap` JSON object mapping **kbId → [prefixes]**. |
| Add the JSON to your integration configuration. |
| Save & verify: upload a test file in each folder and confirm it appears in the expected KB. |
