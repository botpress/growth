## What It Is

This integration enables you to connect your Botpress bot with Segment Analytics, allowing you to update user profiles, track node views, and custom events directly within your bot's flows.

## How It Works

The integration works by using actions to interact with Segment Analytics. Here's a brief overview of the actions:

1. **Update User Profile**: Updates a user's profile with identifying information such as email and name.
2. **Track Node**: Tracks when a specific node within your bot is triggered.
3. **Track Event**: Tracks custom events with optional properties defined in the payload.

These actions are backed by the Segment Analytics API, utilizing a write key to authenticate requests.
