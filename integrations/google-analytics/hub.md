## What It Is

This integration enables you to connect your Botpress bot with Google Analytics, allowing you to update user profiles, track node views, and custom events directly within your bot's flows.

## How It Works

The integration works by using actions to interact with Google Analytics via the Measurement Protocol. Here's a brief overview of the actions:

1. **Update User Profile**: Sends user profile updates to Google Analytics.
2. **Track Node**: Tracks when a specific node within your bot is triggered, sending event data to Google Analytics.
3. **Track Event**: Sends custom event data to Google Analytics, including optional properties defined in the payload.

These actions utilize Google Analytics Measurement ID and optionally an API Secret for secure data transmission.

## Integration Features
