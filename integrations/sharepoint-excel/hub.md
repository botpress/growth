# SharePoint Excel Integration

## Overview

This integration allows you to sync one or many Excel sheets from a SharePoint document library into one or more Botpress tables. You can map each sheet to a specific table, and the integration will automatically create or update tables as needed. Knowledge Base (KB) links are always preservedâ€”tables are never deleted, only cleared and repopulated.

## Configuration

To set up the connector, you need an App registration with the correct API permissions in Microsoft Entra admin center and the following details:

- **Client ID**: Application (client) ID of your App registration.
- **Tenant ID**: Directory (tenant) ID of your App registration.
- **Thumbprint**: Thumbprint of the certificate you uploaded to your App registration.
- **Private key**: Content of your private key used to sign the certificate. **Important**: Only include the content between "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----" and "-----END PRIVATE KEY-----", excluding these header and footer lines. The content should be one continuous string with spaces between each line of the key.
- **Primary Domain**: The SharePoint primary domain (e.g. `contoso`).
- **Site Name**: The name of the SharePoint site.
- **Botpress Personal Access Token (PAT)**: A Personal Access Token from your Botpress workspace, required for Tables API access.

## Action: Sync Excel File

### Inputs
- **sharepointFileUrl**: Relative path to the Excel file in SharePoint. The path should be in the format `/{DOCUMENT_LIBRARY}/{file_path}` where:
  - `DOCUMENT_LIBRARY` is the name of your SharePoint document library (e.g., "Documents", "Shared Documents", or any custom library name)
  - `file_path` is the path to your Excel file within that library, including any subfolders
  - Examples:
    - `/Documents/Book.xlsx` - File in the root of the Documents library
    - `/Shared Documents/Reports/2024/Book.xlsx` - File in a nested folder structure
    - `/MyCustomLibrary/Data/Book.xlsx` - File in a custom document library
- **sheetTableMapping**: Map sheets to tables. Format can be either:
  - Comma-separated: `Sheet1:table1,Sheet2:table2`
  - JSON: `{ "Sheet1": "table1", "Sheet2": "table2" }`

  Each sheet listed will be synced to the specified table. If a table does not exist, it will be created with a schema matching the sheet's columns. If it exists, all rows will be cleared before new data is inserted.

### Example
```json
{
  "sharepointFileUrl": "/doclib1/Book.xlsx",
  "sheetTableMapping": "Sheet1:Customers,Sheet2:Orders"
}
```

## How to's

### How to register an app on Microsoft Entra admin center
- From the Home page of Microsoft Entra admin center, open App registrations (under Applications in the left nav).
- Add a new registration by clicking on "+ New registration".
- Give your app an appropriate name, and click register.
- Open the App registration and take note of the following:
  - `Application (client) ID`
  - `Directory (tenant) ID`

### How to create a certificate for your app registration
- We will be using a self-signed certificate to authenticate. To create a self-signed certificate, run the following commands:
  - `openssl genrsa -out myPrivateKey.key 2048`
  - `openssl req -new -key myPrivateKey.key -out myCertificate.csr`
  - `openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in myCertificate.csr -signkey myPrivateKey.key -out myCertificate.crt`

### How to add your certificate to your app registration
- Navigate to the Azure portal and go to your Azure AD app registration.
- Under "Certificates & secrets," choose "Certificates" and click "Upload certificate."
- Upload your `.crt` file.

### How to update API permissions for your app registration
- Go to "API Permissions" (under the Manage group in your App Registration).
- Click "Add a permission".
- Click on "Microsoft Graph".
- Select "Application permissions" as the type of permission.
- Check `Sites.FullControl.All`, `Sites.Manage.All`, `Sites.Read.All`, `Sites.ReadWrite.All`, `Sites.Selected.All`, `Files.Read.All`, and `Files.ReadWrite.All`.
- Click "Add a permission" again.
- Scroll until you find SharePoint and click on it.
- Select "Application permissions" as the type of permission.
- Check `Sites.FullControl.All`, `Sites.Manage.All`, `Sites.Read.All`, `Sites.ReadWrite.All`, and `Sites.Selected.All`.
- Click "Add permissions."
- You should see all the permissions you added in the permissions list.
- Click on "Grant admin consent for <your_org_name>".

## Notes
- The integration always preserves tables to maintain KB links. Tables are never deleted, only cleared and repopulated.
- If a sheet or table mapping is invalid, the action will fail with a descriptive error.
- Data types for columns are auto-detected (string or number) based on the sheet data.
