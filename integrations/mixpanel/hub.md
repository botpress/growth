## What It Is

This integration enables you to connect your Botpress bot with Mixpanel Analytics, allowing you to update user profiles and track custom events directly within your bot's flows.

## How It Works

The integration works by using actions to interact with Mixpanel Analytics. Here's a brief overview of the actions:

1. **Update User Profile**: Updates a user's profile with identifying information such as email and name.
2. **Track Event**: Tracks custom events with optional properties defined in the payload.

These actions are backed by the Mixpanel Analytics API, utilizing a write key to authenticate requests.
